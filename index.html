            <p>This handsome fellow is named Peanut. He is a Lion lop so his ears always hang down, but that doesn't mean he can't hear you open snacks...</p>

            <p>Junie is a holland lop so she has long ears that always point to the ground. She also has an ear for snacks, but somehow always gets away with not listening to her parents.</p>
